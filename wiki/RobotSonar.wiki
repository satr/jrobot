#summary Robot sonar

= Introduction =

Utrasonic sonar emits sound waives in frequesncy which humans cannot detect. Receiving waives reflected by obstacles, the sonar calculates a distance to it.
Robot sonar is a more complex system including a sonar, a tilt mechanism and calculating software, which provide ready to use information.

= Details =

Robot sonar features
  * Detect obstacle in front of the way
  * Measure distance at the forward halfcircle
  * Make measures in continuos mode
  * Notify about its state (measure made, rotate direction is changed, etc)

To enlight development process - using display with "radar-style" diagram, reflecting distance, measured by the sonar.
